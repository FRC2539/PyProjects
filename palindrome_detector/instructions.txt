Your code should be able to identify palindromes. An example of a 
palindrome would be "tacocat". "tacocat" is the same backwards as 
it is forwards. 

Inputs:
 - A string to check. 

Outputs:
 - String stating whether the input is or is not a palindrome. 
 
Data to check:
"tacocat"
"RAcECaR"
"cow"
"litliceecilit"

View key.py for a solution! (It does not need to be as advanced as the key.py :) )

Bonus: 
 - <10 Lines!
