Rock, Paper, Scissor Game:

Your code should take the input of a player and the random 
input of a bot, and quickly return who won the match of rock,
paper, scissors. Remember:
- Rock beats scissors.
- Scissors beat paper.
- Paper beats rock.
Once your code compares the player's input and the randomly 
generated input, it should return the randomly generated input
and the victor of the match! If the input is not one of the three
options I have given, request a different input. 

Inputs:
 - The hand gesture you would like to call against the AI.

Outputs:
 - The hand gesture of the AI. 
 - The victor of the match (player or the AI). 
 
Data to check:
Scissors
Rock
Paper

View key.py for a solution! (It does not need to be as advanced as the key.py :) )

Bonus: 
 - <25 Lines!
 - Implement the "machine gun", which beats everything!
