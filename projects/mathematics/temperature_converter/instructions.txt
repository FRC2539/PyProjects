Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter:

Rather simple project, just as it sounds. 
Write a program that takes a user's input,
and converts it to Fahrenheit, assuming that it is already
in Celsius! The code should be able to handle
negatives! If the input is not a number, reject it!

Inputs:
 - A number to convert. 

Outputs:
 - String stating the converted temperature (include the scale if you do the bonus)!
 
Data to check (do not go above 30!):
100
39
-11
Hi

View key.py for a solution! (It does not need to be as advanced as the key.py :) )

Bonus: 
 - Make it work backwards! (fahrenheit to celsius)
 - <20 Lines!
