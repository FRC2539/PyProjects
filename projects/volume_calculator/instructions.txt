Volume Calculator

WARNING: Moderately Difficult

The goal of this assignment is to be able to utilize classes
in a simple manner. You should prompt the user for the dimensions
of a rectangular prism. Continue to ask them if they would like
to submit another set of dimensions until they don't want to. 
At this point, you should have the dimensions (the height, length,
and width) of multiple rectangular prisms. The goal is to calculate 
the volume of each individual rectangular prism, and them combine
them to get the total volume. Imagine you are taking a variety of
different blocks, stacking them, and then calculating the structure's
total volume! Only accept positive integers for the dimensions. Also,
assume that all the dimensions are of the same units. Lastly, the 
formula for the volume of such as structure is as follows:

volume = length * width * height

Remember, the goal of this is to practice classes and objects.
So, create an object for each of the blocks!

Inputs:
 - A string stating whether or not the user wants to create another rectangular prism.
 - A height for each rectangular prism.
 - A length for each rectangular prism.
 - A width for each rectangular prism.

Outputs:
 - The total volume of the structure. 
 
Data to check (separated in quotations):

Any - do math, make sure your system works.
