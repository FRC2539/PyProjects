The Factory:

Hello. This project is going to be significantly different
than what we have been doing. Now that you know a lot about 
math, looping, and OOP, it's time to apply all these in a 
large-scale environment. Or, at least larger. This project 
should be thorough and detailed. This is the closest thing 
we might get to an actual robot program! Hopefully not however!

So, "The Factory" is going to be a logical and imaginary factory,
which is going to function as you program it. There will be multiple 
individual machines to program. In fact, you can continue to add
on as many machines as you'd like! This factory can produce anything
you want it to! Whether that's diapers, Coca Cola, toothpase,
or whatever! YOU just need to do the "logic" behind this. You need to 
think of what machines you'd need, how much they cost, and how much 
you produce. All of the basics of each machine should be covered!
Remember to account for costs and efficiency of each machine. 
Eventually, we will implement a maintenance cost too! At the end of the 
day, this is supposed to be a fun, game-like task. Try to make this 
factory profitable, but reasonable! Also be unique; for example, if
you're doing a Coca cola factory, make the machines be like a dispenser,
a capping machine, and a packaging machine. Make it unique to the 
product!

We will be covering this in many different parts, so we go nice and slow. 
Therefore, each of you should create a folder using your name. For
example, if I was doing this, I'd call my folder "benb". Go ahead and
create your folder now.

Congratulations. There is the first step! Next, we are going to write
any informative text stating what the factory is going to produce and 
the machines its going to employ. 

Again, congrats! You did it!

Next, go into each chapter folder and read the instructions folder.
Start with chapter one!
