Prime Number Detector:

Your code should be able to identify prime numbers. An example of a 
prime number would be 5. The number 5 has no factors other than 1 and 
itself. Prime numbers must also be positive! Another example could 
be 11, or 277.

Inputs:
 - A value to check. 

Outputs:
 - String stating whether the input is or is not prime. If the input is 
 not valid, do nothing. 
 
Data to check:
4
311
564738
-9
12533

View key.py for a solution! (It does not need to be as advanced as the key.py :) )

Bonus: 
 - <20 Lines!
 - Can detect and return data that is not an integer type!
