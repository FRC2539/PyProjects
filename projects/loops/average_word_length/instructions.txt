Average Word Length:

Your code should take a large string with any number of words.
The code should count the length of each word, but NOT count punctuation
and other such things. Once you find the average of all the words, 
print it as a string. Integers, such as '6', should be considered a word. 
Titles such as 'Mr. Bistline' should be ignored. For example, when measuring
the average word length of the last statement, you would just measure 'Bistline'.

Inputs:
 - A text to get the average word length of. 

Outputs:
 - String stating the average length of the words in that input. 
 
Data to check (separated in quotations):

"The quick brown fox jumped over the small brown log."

"Where can I get a glass of water? Do you not know?"

"We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, 
establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, 
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves 
and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United 
States of America."
