Mersenne Prime Number Detector:

WARNING: Moderately difficult!

Your code should be able to identify Mersenne
prime numbers. A Mersenne prime number is a prime 
number that is one less than the number two to a 
prime power. Little confusing? An example: seven, is 
a Mersenne prime number. Why? Three is prime, and 2^3 
minus one is seven! Your code should take a number which 
will act as an upper limit. The lower limit will be zero.
Find all the prime numbers between these limits, set them
as an exponent to two, then check to see if that product 
minus one is a prime number. There. Solved it! Have fun!
The input should be greater than zero and a whole number. 
If it isn't, reject it!

Inputs:
 - An integer acting as an upper limit.

Outputs:
 - String(s) listing the Mersenne prime numbers within the range, as well as their related exponents.
