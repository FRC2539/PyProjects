# PyProjects
A collection of small projects for new students. Allows them to hone their Python skills!

Students should find the folder of the project they'd like to complete, make a new 
python file (use your name as the filename), read the instruction file, and then 
have at it! 

When you're finished, check the key.py. If it is not there, then tell Ben or whoever is
in charge, as they will have them on their local machine. 

Note: the key.py for each project will cover how to do the bonuses for each project as well.
